The compiler is completely implemented; all regression tests pass except:

For some reason, CondExpr.java (off the class website) executes the full 25
function calls (defined in meggy/arg_opts) when compiled with my compiler but
only executes each function call once when compiled with javac (regardless of
the number in arg_opts). So the output from my compiled program has the
correct lines, but when arg_opts is > 5 they will be repeated and this shows
in the diff of the regression test. Not sure why the javac version seems to
ignore the arg_opts specification here.
