CS453 PA4

This is the PA4 compiler, and everything is implemented. I expect everything to
work, including widening of bytes passed as int parameters. Maze Solver also
works.

It compiles with warnings about unchecked casts in the Parser generated by CUP,
they don't seem to cause any problems though and I wasn't able to get rid of
them.

New Test Cases:
