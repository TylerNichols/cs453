The compiler is completely implemented and we expect it to work when run with 
the commands specified in the assignment sanity check.

No AST is generated or visited; the parser generates the assembly code directly.



Test cases added:
ints.in[.OK]
errints.in[.OK]
spec.in[.OK]
errspec.in[.OK]
errresrv.in[.OK]

Regarding int literals, we assumed no leading zeros; in other words, a single 
zero is the only int literal that begins with a zero (see errints.in test 
case). All leading zeros will be scanned separately as single, standalone zeros.

IDs are defined as a letter or underscore followed by 0 or more alphanumeric 
characters or underscores.
