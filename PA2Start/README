CS453 PA4

This is the PA4 compiler, and everything is implemented. I expect everything to
work, including widening of bytes passed as int parameters. Maze Solver also
works.

New Test Cases:
	   TestCasesMeggy/MoreClasses.java
	   TestCasesMeggy/OneCond.java
	   TestCasesMeggy/PA4MazeSolver.java
	   TestCasesMeggy/PA4bluedot.java
	   TestCasesMeggy/RecTest.java
	   TestCasesMeggy/Widen.java
